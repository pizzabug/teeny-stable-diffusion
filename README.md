# teeny-stable-diffusion
A repository that uses the Diffusers library to finetune and train Stable Diffusion models in PyTorch Lightning. Written for experiments surrounding permissive datasets and data augmentation. Still a work in progress.

## Progress 🚧

### Roadmap 🗺️
- [ ] Train or finetune a Diffuser U-Net.
- [ ] Train or finetune a VAE prior.
- [ ] Train or finetune a CLIP encoder as the LDM's text encoder.
- [ ] Create preprocessor and dataloader for Unsplash-25K.
- [ ] Train LDM on Unsplash-25K dataset.
- [ ] Train LDM+CLIP on Unsplash-25K dataset.
